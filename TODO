1) Check why upon initialization device 00:1b (Audio) gets its pci id's from dev 00:1f (ISA bus host), this could be why the IRQ is failing, as they are sent to the wrong bus
1# This problem seems to be non existent as both 8086:8119 and 811b share the same sub-device and sub-vendor id: 8086:8119, that could still be an issue when it comes to IRQ routing

2) Hard drive freeze
2# This seems to be caused when the lspci probe is left active in 'less' mode, the other option of a PIC bus freez-up caused by access to the audio device was eliminated through testing

3) The IRQ routing device on PCI bus 0 domain 0 seems to be @ 0000.00.1f which is the LPC bridge or the IDA bridge, biosdecode does not provide sufficient information

4) The IRQ line and pin parts of the configuration register of the audio device(1b) seem to be non-initialized as tehy show 0, non the less the -vv option on lspci shows the correct IRQ is assigned

5) The HDA controller seems to support MSI, as the capabilities of the device show, the questio is why no interrupts make it to or form the device
